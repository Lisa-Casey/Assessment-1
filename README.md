# About me: 

Hi everyone, my name is Lisa Casey, I am from Far North QLD where I was born and have lived for 90% of my life. I was previously studying Bachelor of Accounting, but when I my career moved into the Mortgage Broking industry and I started working alongside Financial Planners my path changed direction and I am now on my journey to completing my Financial Planning Degree. Hmmm, an interesting fact I guess is that I haven't always been an office worker, I used to work as a Nipper which is a position in underground mining.


# What is my interest in IT:

Even though IT is heavily relied upon in my life, it is something that I do not have a direct interest in. I do ensure that I am highly competent and using the software I do need for my career to its full advantage, but outside of work and general IT that we all use for everyday life, I have no desire to widen my skills on a hobby or professional level. 


# Why did I choose RMIT:

I chose to study Bachelor of Business (Financial Planning) through RMIT, as this Bachelor Degree satisfies the education requirements to become a Financial Planner and can be studied externally through OUA.


# What do I expect to learn during my studies:

I am hoping to get a grasp on the fundamental information and application techniques/procedures etc that I will need to become not only a successful Financial Planner but a successful manager and gradually business owner. My goal is to move from a broking position into a para-planner position to be able to use the skills learned through RMIT on a daily basis. 


# Ideal Job:

My ideal career would be as a Financial Planner, working in a large group of like-minded professionals with a focus on business client portfolio’s. The position I have linked below would be my ideal position as the employer is searching for an individual who can provide holistic and ethical advise which aligns with my personal goals, and I enjoy a workplace that focuses on the bigger picture.

To be successful in this position: the applicant would need to be currently employed in a similar role with their tertiary degree being FPA approved since the new regulations have come into play. I feel this company would rely heavily on past experience and would be needing relevant references to discuss prior work ethics, quality and general attributes of the applicant. Proven excellence would be a must with the chance of applicants needing to demonstrate their skills and work quality by presenting an example of an SOA task assignment or by demonstrating their ability with a client appointment. 

My current skills and qualifications: are not even close to where I need to be to be successful in such a position as I am currently only half way through completely my bachelor’s degree. My current position within Mortgage Broking and previous experience within working in accounting firms has enabled me to learn a lot of skills that will be useful for reaching my goals such as working directly with customers, liaising with business owners, currently obtaining objectives and goals from clients, networking and working in a team environment. My current role has exposed me to the Financial Planning world and I work alongside multiple planners and paraplanners and we have a successful referral basis between us. My working attributes is that I am hardworking, dedicated, loyal, I have great initiative practices, and excellent problem-solving skills. I have been described as, being level headed and a great team player with eye for detail and being emotionally available for colleagues in need of support or encouragement. 


# My plan:

My goals for the next 5 years are:
1.	Year 1 - Continue studying my bachelor degree, and continue working in the mortgage broking industry, building strong client relationships and educate them in a way that when the time comes they will trust me also in a financial planning position
2.	Year 2 – Move within my current employment from a mortgage broking role into a para-planning role
3.	Year 3 – Finish degree and graduate
4.	Year 4 – Start first professional year as financial planner under the supervision of a senior planner, learn as much as I can from the planner supervising me, enrol in extra training and courses to improve skills, i.e. life coaching, professional networking training etc
5.	Year 5 – First year as unsupervised financial planner (my ideal role)



# Personal Profile:

Recently our workplace undertook a 10-week life coaching course to help us learn about ourselves, our colleagues and how to work effectively as a team. To ensure that the testing was accurate I undertook two different Myer-Briggs test and achieved the same results:

I then undertook a learning test through Education Planner and received the followed result to my learning style:

The third test I chose the Big 5 Personality Test and the results were as follows:

# Results: 

After completing the different types of tests and looking over the results it has revealed that I am an extroverted individual, with strong feelings that are passionate towards what I set my mind to along with being compassionate with others. The results have said that I am disciplined, well organised and eager to please. The results show that I dedicated, patient and eager to please which within a team can be very beneficial as well as that it mentioned I work best in team environments with the ability to work well under pressure and be conscientious of how colleagues / team mates are feeling. When forming a team desirably I would be on the lookout for like minded students, that are of a similar learning type with the one exception that one particular individual has strengths in leading/driving a team and would exercise the leadership position, but still having similar values and goals as my own.
